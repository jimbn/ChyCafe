      <h2>Hi there,</h2>
      <h4>So you want to know a little about me?</h4>
      <p>The name is Chynna (pronounced like China, the country). I am happily engaged to Nick, whom I've been with for over a decade. I am a Los Angeles native with a Bachelor's Degree in Communications. I'm also in the process of earning my Master's Degree.</p>
      <p>I grew up visiting Disneyland with my family every year. Once I purchased a Disneyland Annual Pass, I began visiting Disneyland nearly every week. Disney Cruises are my obsession. Nick and I have been on 5 Disney Cruises so far and plan to go on our 6th one when the new ship, the Disney Wish, sets sail.</p>
      <p>Because I love all things Disney, I have a passion for sharing tips, how-to's, DIYs, and whatever you can name that's related to the parks, resorts, entertainment, everything Disney!</p>
